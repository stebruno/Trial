Hello ! I am currently a third-year PhD candidate in Machine Learning at [Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/) (CMAP) at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), advised by [Alain Durmus](https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). Prior to this, I graduated with a MSc. degree in Applied Mathematics from École Polytechnique ("[Cycle Ingénieur](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien)") and a MRes. degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning ("[MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)") from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

I am interested in the study of problems at the intersection of generative modelling, sampling, dynamic optimal transport and stochastic optimal control (with a special focus on the **Schrödinger Bridge** problem and **score-based diffusion models**). I am humbly contributing to propose new theoretical perspectives on these subjects as well as developing large-scale algorithms for applications.
