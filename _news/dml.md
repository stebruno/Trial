I am invited to be part of the [DML programme](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/dml/) (*Diffusions in machine learning: Foundations, generative models and non-convex optimisation*) organised by the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, which takes place in July 2024 at the Alan Turing Institute. I will give a long talk on my latest work [Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10758), bridging gaps between MCMC methods and recent diffusion/flow-based approaches.
